## SCSS Code Explanation: Using the `$parent` Variable in `.card` Class

In the following SCSS (Sass) code snippet, the `$parent` variable is employed to store a reference to the parent selector (`&`) of the `.card` class. This enables reusing the parent selector within nested contexts, where direct access to the parent selector might be limited due to the nesting structure inherent in SCSS.

### Breakdown of `$parent` Variable Usage

1. The `$parent` variable is initially defined within the `.card` block, setting its value as `&`. Here, `&` represents the parent selector itself. In this specific case, the parent selector corresponds to `.card`.

2. Inside the `.card` block, two distinct variations of styles are defined based on the `[data-type]` attribute of the `.card` element.

3. For the first variation (`[data-type="product"]`), a nested block contains styles tailored to instances where the `[data-type]` attribute is set to `"product"`.

   Inside this nested block:

   - The `$parent` variable is utilized to reference the parent selector (`.card`). This reference is used to generate a selector for a child element: `#{$parent}__content`. The generated selector combines the parent selector and `__content`, resulting in `.card__content`. This strategy facilitates the application of styles to the `.card__content` element within the context of the `.card[data-type="product"]` variation.

   - The `.button` class is absolutely positioned within the context of the `.card[data-type="product"]` variation.

4. In the second variation (`[data-type="link-with-image"]`), a similar application of the `$parent` variable is observed.

   Inside this nested block:

   - The `$parent` variable is again utilized to establish a selector for a child element: `#{$parent}__content`. This results in the selector becoming `.card__content` within the context of `.card[data-type="link-with-image"]`.

   - Styling for an image is defined within this context.

### Summary

In summary, the `$parent` variable is ingeniously used to dynamically generate selectors for child elements within specific contexts defined by the `[data-type]` attribute of the `.card` element. This approach facilitates the maintenance of consistent styling for various `.card` variations while minimizing redundancy and enhancing maintainability.

      right: $size-16;
      transform: translateY(-50%);
    }

}

text-decoration: none;

    @include interactive-scale($neutral-100, $blue-800);

    #{$parent}__content {
      padding: $size-16 $size-12;
    }

    img {
      height: 8.75rem;
      width: 100%;
      object-fit: cover;
      object-position: top center;
    }

}
}`
